topologic (https://test.pypi.org/project/topologicpy/)


# CADModelAzimuth
	-Nominal CADModelAzimuth is 0.
	-In Revit true north was shifted 45 degrees east of project north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit true north.
	-In Revit project north was shifted 90 degrees east of true north to generate a change in CADModelAzimuth.
	-CADModelAzimuth did not change >> CADModelAzimuth is not linked to Revit project north >> CADModelAzimuth is constant 0 >> gbXML coordinates change as required.
	
# Revit gbXML >> Surface >> RectangularGeometry >> CartesianPoint
	-Designates centroid of the surface.
	
# Revit gbXML >> Surface >> Opening >> RectangularGeometry >> CartesianPoint
	-Third coordinate >> zero or missing.
	-Distance of the bottom-left corner of the opening to the bottom-left corner of the parent surface.
